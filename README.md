# Banner Magic 1.0.0
Banner Magic is a semi-automatic HTML banner creation application that can be used to speed up the process of creating a range of generic banners.

## Installation
Clone banner magic and then run `npm install` to download all the dependencies.

## Using the application
There is currently a three step process to using Banner Magic.

### Uploading a template
Once you have created one HTML banner and it has been tested and put through a QA process. Take the HTML code for the banner - which will most likely be from your local development environment - and navigate to the file `models.js` that can be found in the root of the application.

Once inside this file, you will see a function that will return the HTML template into the main `app.js`. To update the template, paste the HTML code between the back-ticks, like so...

```
const Model = () => {
  return `

  <PASTE YOUR TEMPLATE HTML CODE HERE>

  `
};

module.exports = {
  Model
};
```

To add variables into the code, firstly you will need to reference the name of the variable inside the parentheses of the Model function. So here will will add the title, colour and image link variables.

```
const Model = (title, colour, imgLink) => {
```

You can these reference these in your HTML template using the template literal method - `${VARIABLE_NAME}`.
